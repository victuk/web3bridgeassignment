<div>• Company name: Kennis Viden Ltd. </div>

<div>• Registered address: 9 Udosen Street off Etebi, Eket, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. </div>

<div>• Registration Number: 19597 35</div>

<div>• Tax Identification Number: 31073061 -0001 </div>

<div>• Business Name: YourTrovi Integrated Services. </div>

<div>• Registered address: 9 Udosen Street off Etebi, Eket, Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria. </div>

<div>• Trademark : Trovi & Device  </div>

<div>• Trademark Representation: Trovi's logo </div>

<div>1. Object </div>

<div>1.1 Trovi is a business enterprise that handles the   development & management of a</div>

<div>technology platform through which certain local  stores in a number of territories can offer</div>

<div>their products and/or services by means o f a mobile or web application on the platform</div>

<div>(hereinafter, the  "APP") and, in an ancillary manner, where applicable and if so requested</div>

<div>through the APP by users of the APP and consumers of the said local  stores, act as an</div>

<div>intermediary in the planned or immediate delivery of the products. </div>

<div>1.2 Trovi has developed a Platform through which a variety of merchants, with which Trovi</div>

<div>can have in place a commercial agreement for the use of  the platform offers a selection of</div>

<div>products and/or services. Buyers can r equest the purchase and/or collection of products and</div>

<div>services from such  merchants in person by means of a mandate given by them to a third</div>

<div>party when placing an order through the Platform. In such cases, Trovi acts  as a mere</div>

<div>intermediary and is therefor e unable to assume, and does not assume, any responsibility for the</div>

<div>quality of the products or for the  proper provision of the services offered directly by the</div>

<div>merchants or by such third parties. </div>

<div>1.3 In addition, Trovi is a multi -category Technology Platf orm for intermediation in the</div>

<div>contracting of "on -demand" services by distance electronic  means. Its aim is to make it easier</div>

<div>for any persons requiring help with their errands, services, purchases in person and/or</div>

<div>collection of products  from local merchan ts (hereinafter, "Business Owners or Partners") to</div>

<div>carry out their errands by delegating to such third parties, who are willing  to voluntarily carry</div>

<div>out the mandate given to them by Buyers (hereinafter, the "Shoppers"). </div>

<div>1.4 Shoppers are thus a network of self-employed professionals who work with Trovi.</div>

<div>When they wish to provide their services, they log onto the  Shoppers App ("the Platform")</div>

<div>and undertake to carry out within a certain amount of time the service entrusted to them by the</div>

<div>Buyers by means  of the above -mentioned mandate. As a result, Trovi cannot be</div>

<div>responsible for delivery times, as they will depend on the local stores' own </div>

<div> successful operations, the preparation of orders, the Shoppers themselves, and the</div>

<div>information furnished by the Buyer when placing orders or  their availability and response at</div>

<div>the time of delivery. In relation to this, the deliv ery times stated on the Site are provided for</div>

<div>within the territory in which Trovi operates. Similarly, a User may ask a  Shopper to</div>

<div>purchase products in person on his/her behalf and to collect them from, and deliver them to,</div>

<div>the addresses specified. The Shopper  undertakes under a mand ate to purchase the</div>

<div>products ordered by the User on the latter's behalf and according to his/her indications and</div>

<div> specifications. </div>

<div>4.2 Users are solely responsible for providing the correct addresses for delivery and</div>

<div>collection on the Platform, and they, th erefore, release Trovi and  the Shopper from any</div>

<div>liability for negligence or error in the collection or delivery of the order as a result of providing</div>

<div>incorrect addresses for  collection and delivery. As a result of the foregoing, the cost</div>

<div>resulting from p roviding an incorrect address for collection and delivery on the  Platform</div>

<div>shall be borne by the User. </div>

<div>4.3 Users must provide all the information, in as much detail as possible, about the service</div>

<div>to which the assignment relates and, if applicable, in  relation to the product that they</div>

<div>are asking the Shopper to buy in a physical shop on their behalf. To do this,  they may provide</div>

<div>any comments  they may deem useful in the "comments" section as well as, where</div>

<div>appropriate, share a photograph with the Shopper to identify the order. Users  will be in</div>

<div>constant contact with the Shopper and may communicate with him/her at  any time to ensure</div>

<div>that he/she carries out the mandate  according to the Users' own instructions. </div>

<div>4.4 In order to facilitate direct communication with the Shopper and in the event of any</div>

<div>incidents in the processing of the order and/or in order to  inform of any changes thereto, the</div>

<div>User can reach out to Trovi via email at hello@trovi.shop </div>

<div>4.5 The User releases Trovi and the Shopper from any liability for negligence or error in</div>

<div>the indications given by the User for the purchase of the   product ordered for</div>

<div>purchase in a physical store on his/her behalf. As a result, the User shall bear the cost arising</div>

<div>from providing incorrect   indications on the Platform regarding the products (such</div>

<div>as an incorrect address or product). </div>

<div>4.6 If the price of the product/servi ce does appear on the Platform, the prices appearing on</div>

<div>the Platform may be indicative of any taxes that may be  applicable based on the territory</div>

<div>from which the Buyer operates and shall in any event be denominated in the currency in force</div>

<div>in the territory   from which the User operates. However, the prices of the products sold</div>

<div>in restaurants and/or stores shown on the Trovi Platform may be  indicative only. In any</div>

<div>event, they correspond to the products sold in restaurants and/or stores, and they are set sol ely</div>

<div>by them. The Buyer may  contact the Business Owner, Merchant or Partner to confirm the</div>

<div>final price of the products ordered. </div>

<div>4.7 If the product and/or service is not available, the Shopper   for now will mark the item</div>

<div>as "Not Found" via the app for shoppers.   The buyer  would be notified, get refunded</div>

<div>and the business enterprise would be alerted of an item or items possibly out of st ock in their</div>

<div>store. It is  recommended that a shopper can chat the buyer too to notify them of the items</div>

<div>that have not been found in -store during the shopping process,  call the User to set out the </div>

<div>available options. If the User does not accept any of  the options set . If the User does</div>

<div>not answer the phone, the  Shoppers shall wait 5 minutes before leaving. </div>

<div>4.8 Users accept that according to the services contracted through the Trovi platform, they</div>

<div>can receive the invoices corresponding to the delivery,  courier or management services,</div>

<div>by the Shoppers   .</div>

<div>4.9 If the User is not at the place agreed for delivery, the Shopper shall retain the product</div>

<div>for 24 hours, or at least 10 minutes in the case of perishable  products. In addition, the</div>

<div>User must bear 100% of the cost of the basic courier service, as well as the price of the product</div>

<div>if one has been  purchased or contracted through the Shopper at the User's request, and</div>

<div>will have to pay for another service in order to receive the products that  were not delivere d.</div>

<div>The Shopper will in no event be liable for the deterioration or expiry of the product to which</div>

<div>the assignment is related. </div>

<div>4.10 Once the assignment has been completed, if the request included the in -person purchase</div>

<div>of a product, the Shopper shall keep th e receipts of such payment for proof that they shopped</div>

<div>the groceries. The User would receive their receipts via the app or by email. If the object of the</div>

<div>assignment is the mere delivery of a product, the Shopper shall deliver it  to the User at the</div>

<div>exact t ime and place indicated by the latter. All this without prejudice to the electronic receipt</div>

<div>for the service that will be  received by the User at the e -mail address associated with his/her</div>

<div>account. </div>

<div>4.11 At that moment, the User, who is the recipient of the  service identified by the User in</div>

<div>the order, or any third party authorised by him/her, must  where appropriate, ratify the</div>

<div>mandate given by signing on the Shopper's device. Trovi is unable to verify the authenticity of</div>

<div>the User's signature.  If the User r eceives confirmation that the order has been carried out</div>

<div>without having ratified the mandate either personally or through a recipient  authorised</div>

<div>by him/her, he/she must inform Trovi immediately so that appropriate steps can be taken by</div>

<div>the Platform. Trovi  reserves the right to  check any communications made by the User for</div>

<div>verification and monitoring purposes. </div>

<div>4.12 FOOD / PACKAGED PRODUCTS: Trovi recommends that, when ordering food</div>

<div>products under a mandate, Users ask the Shopper and/or the  establishment offering the</div>

<div>products, using the methods available on the Platform, for information on the content and</div>

<div>composition of the food  products ordered. </div>

<div>4.13 Furthermore, Trovi is not responsible for ensuring that food orders are delivered to</div>

<div>Users in properly closed bags, which should ideally be  labelled or sealed.  </div>

<div>5. Returning Non -Perishable Products </div>

<div>5.1 If a User wishes to return a non -perishable product or make a claim about the provision</div>

<div>of a service, without prejudice to Trovi's liability as an  intermediary to take over the</div>

<div>handling thereof, the party with ultimate liability will always be the Merchant/Business</div>

<div>Owner/Partner at which the  purchase was made. If the User obtains a refund for the purchase</div>

<div>price, the Merchant will decide how to m ake the refund (cash, debit card, store  voucher,</div>

<div>etc.) regardless of whether it is Trovi who pays the refund on the local Merchant's behalf.</div>

<div>Therefore, the return of a non -perishable  product purchased by the Shopper pursuant to a </div>

<div>mandate conferred by the  User shall be subject to the exceptions found on the Terms &</div>

<div>Conditions page if stated and Merchant's returns policy in any event. </div>

<div>5.2 As certain establishments may not have premises open to the public, Users will be</div>

<div>unable to access them for the purpose of processing any  claims or returns. In such cases,</div>

<div>they must contact Trovi's User assistance service or the necessary help and support using the</div>

<div>channels  available on the Platform. </div>



<div>5.3 If a User wishes to process the return of a non -perishable product because it did not</div>

<div>match the order made through the platform, he/she must   provide a photograph of</div>

<div>the total order together with a list of the incorrect or undelivered products, as well as other</div>

<div>proof of the inadequacy of  the product requested. </div>

<div>5.4 The U ser must check the non -perishable products delivered by the Shopper at the</div>

<div>delivery address before signing and, where appropriate,  ratifying the mandate. By means</div>

<div>of the said signature, the User confirms and ratifies the mandate, the purchase in person or  the</div>

<div>service carried  out on his/her behalf. In addition, the User states that a third party may</div>

<div>ratify the mandate on his/her behalf, for example, if the User is  not at the  final</div>

<div>delivery address or has designated a third party for collection and signat ure where appropriate.</div>

<div>The User (and/or the said third  party) is  thus responsible for checking that the</div>

<div>service provided is adequate as well as, where applicable, for collecting enough evidence to</div>

<div>prove  that it was not. </div>

<div>5.5 In any event, the decision re garding whether a return is appropriate will lie with the</div>

<div>Merchant/Business Owner/Partner in each case. The User  must therefore inform Trovi</div>

<div>through the methods provided by Trovi for that purpose if a dispute arises. </div>

<div>6.1        Shopping Fees & Service Fee s</div>

<div>6.1.1  Users can register for the Platform, and use it, free of charge, although this is subject to</div>

<div>review by Trovi at any time. Users may have to pay for  certain services on the Platform as</div>

<div>provided in these General Terms and Conditions of Use. </div>

<div>6.1.2  Shopping fees are charged to compensate Trovi shoppers who shop and deliver</div>

<div>groceries to buyers. This fee varies based on how far or near a buyer's delivery address is from</div>

<div>the store they're ordering from. This fee also helps Trovi continuously improve its s ervices to</div>

<div>all our users as we strive to deliver satisfaction to everyone using an aspect of our product or</div>

<div>service. </div>

<div>6.1.3  The amount of the service fee can be fixed or variable according to the value of the</div>

<div>products. Trovi sets the service and makes it vi sible to Users  at the moment of the</div>

<div>checkout of every order.  </div>

<div>6.1.4  The Service fee are charged based on the financial worth of the products a consumer</div>

<div>purchases. This would be charged using the consumers preferred payment to pay for an order.</div>

<div>The service  fee increases or reduces based on the worth of groceries (in local currency) a buyer</div>

<div>purchases.   </div>

<div>6.1.5  The User only has to pay for each service requested through the platform for his/her</div>

<div>use thereof to order products, and to communicate through  the platform, as well as for the</div>

<div>courier or errand services provided by third parties. </div>

<div>6.1.6  In the event of rai n or bad weather conditions, the User will have to pay an additional</div>

<div>fee for the courier or errand service provided by third  parties in such weather conditions. </div>

<div>6.1.7  In addition, for services that include the purchase of a product, the User must pay the</div>

<div>price of such product. By registering through the platform  and providing the required bank</div>

<div>details, Users expressly authorise Trovi to issue receipts for payment of the services requested,</div>

<div>including the  price and delivery of the products ordered. </div>

<div>6.1.8  The total price of each service may be composed of a variable percentage based on the</div>

<div>number of kilometres travelled and the time taken by the  Shopper, as well as, where</div>

<div>applicable in cases in which a User requests the physical purchase of a product or ser vice, the</div>

<div>price established by  each Merchant/Business Owner/Partner. Trovi reserves the right to</div>

<div>change the price based on the distance travelled and/or the time slot in which  the service</div>

<div>is performed.  In accordance with these terms, the User will be ent itled to know the</div>

<div>approximate fee for the service before  contracting it and paying for it, unless the User</div>

<div>has not specified the address for collection.  The fee for the delivery service may vary in</div>

<div> cases of Force Majeure beyond Trovi's control that entai ls an increase in such fee. </div>

<div>6.1.9  The fee may include tips for the Shopper and/or the local store, whose amount shall be</div>

<div>solely and entirely at the User's discretion. </div>

<div>6.1.10  Trovi reserves the right to change the prices on the Platform at any time. Such</div>

<div>changes shall take effect immediately after   publication.  The User expressly</div>

<div>authorised Trovi to send him/her by electronic means, to the e -mail address provided by the</div>

<div>User during the   registration process, receipts for the services contracted and/or</div>

<div>the bills generated. If an invoice is required, the User must enter the relevant tax  data on the</div>

<div>platform before placing the order. </div>

<div>6.1.11  If a service is cancelled by the User once the preparation of the order by the local</div>

<div>merchant has been confirmed and the  User has been informed,  Trovi will be entitled to</div>

<div>charge the User the fee applicable in each case. Similarly, if the User has asked the Shopper to</div>

<div>purchase a product on  his/her behalf and the User cancels the order after the purchase</div>

<div>has been made, the latter shall bear the cost of the delivery services provided by  the</div>

<div>Shopper as well as the full price of the product. All this without prejudice to the User's ability</div>

<div>to request a new service in order to return the  products purchased or to have them</div>

<div>delivered at a different address. In the case of non -perishable products, the User may exercise</div>

<div>his/her right  of withdrawal vis -à-vis the merchant that sold him/her the products. If the User</div>

<div>wishes to exercise this right through Trovi, he/she must request  the service again. </div>

<div>6.2 Payment Platforms </div>

<div>6.2.1  Payment for products and/or services offered on the Platform, sold in person at</div>

<div>restaurants and/or stores and delivered to Users in a deferred  manners is temporarily</div>

<div>made to Trovi, who then sends it to the rest aurants and/or stores with which it has a commercial</div>

<div>agreement in place. The  associated restaurants and/or establishments authorise Trovi to</div>

<div>accept payment on their behalf. Payment of the price of any product (such as food, drink, a gift, </div>

<div>etc.), are proce ssesed by Trovi's payment partner and money is only distributed after an order</div>

<div>gas been received successfully by the buyer who placed the order. </div>

<div>6.2.2  Similarly, the User's payment releases him/her from any obligation vis -à-vis the</div>

<div>Shopper, as full payment  from the User discharges any  obligation that the User may have</div>

<div>vis-à-vis restaurants and/or stores and/or Shoppers   .</div>

<div>6.2.3  Payment by Users for products and/or services is received at Trovi's accounts through</div>

<div>an Electronic Money Institution. Electronic Money  Institutions are authorised to provide,</div>

<div>directly or indirectly, regulated payment services in all the territories in wh ich Trovi operates</div>

<div>and are in  compliance with the current legislation applicable to payment services for</div>

<div>Platforms such as Trovi. NOTE  that if such institutions are not  authorised, Trovi will</div>

<div>accept no liability for such lack of authorisation or licence,  and sole and exclusive liability shall</div>

<div>lie with the Electronic  Money Institutions. </div>

<div>6.2.4  Using t  he payment provider contracted by it for this purpose and for the sole purpose</div>

<div>of verifying the means of payment provided, Trovi  reserves the right, as a fr aud prevention</div>

<div>measure, to request a payment pre -authorisation for the products ordered through the platform.</div>

<div>Such pre - authorisation shall in no event involve payment of the full amount of the order,</div>

<div>as this will be done solely and exclusively after the p roducts have  been made available to the</div>

<div>User, or for the reasons set forth in these terms and conditions. </div>

<div>6.2.5  In order to provide Users with greater support, Trovi shall be their first point of contact</div>

<div>and shall accept liability for payments made on the   Platform. Such liability includes refunds,</div>

<div>returns, cancellations and early -stage dispute resolution, and it is without prejudice to any</div>

<div>actions that  may be taken by Trovi vis -à-vis local merchants as the sole physical sellers of</div>

<div>the products ordered by  Users. </div>

<div>6.2.6  In accordance with the foregoing, in the event of a dispute, Trovi shall provide the first</div>

<div>line of support and shall reimburse the User if    deemed necessary. </div>

<div>6.2.7  If a User has any issues with the progress of his/her order, he/she should fi rst contact</div>

<div>the shopper who accepted their order and may go ahead to contact Trovi's User assistance</div>

<div>service through the contact options made  available to Users on the Platform. </div>

<div>6.2.8 Users must be available to accept and receive orders from the delivery addresses they</div>

<div>provide on the app and must be available at these destinations to receive their items Being</div>

<div>available to communicate with their shopper's online via phone calls or via messaging on the</div>

<div>respective Trovi app. </div>

<div>7. Price of the Products and/or Se rvices Appearing on the Platform </div>

<div>7.1 All the prices stated on the Platform are inclusive of any taxes that may be applicable</div>

<div>based on the territory from which the User operates and  shall in any event be denominated</div>

<div>in the currency in force in the territor y from which the User operates. </div>

<div>7.2 In accordance with Clause 6 above, the prices applicable to each service shall be as</div>

<div>published on the Platform, subject to the specific  characteristics set forth above, and</div>

<div>applied automatically at the last stage of the  contracting process.  </div>

<div>7.3 However, the prices of the products sold in restaurants and/or stores shown on the Trovi</div>

<div>Platform may be indicative only. In any event, they  correspond to the products sold in</div>

<div>restaurants and/or stores, and they are set solely by  them. The User may contact the Shopper</div>

<div>to confirm the  final price of the products ordered. </div>

<div>7.4 The User assumes that, in any case, the price of some products may change in real -time</div>

<div>based on the establishment that sells them and on the  available stock. The User may</div>

<div>contact Trovi for any information about the order placed. </div>

<div>7.5 In accordance with the foregoing, the User grants the Shopper, by means of the</div>

<div>purchase and delivery request made through the Platform, a  mandate to purchase the</div>

<div>products in person, on his/her behalf, at the price set by the Merchant/Business Owner/Partner.</div>

<div>The User may be in  direct contact with the Shopper while the order is being carried out. </div>

<div>8. Promotional Codes and/or Other Offers or Di scounts </div>

<div>8.1 Trovi may unilaterally provide at any time credits for use within the Platform or free</div>

<div>shipping to certain Users. The User acknowledges and   accepts that credits and</div>

<div>free shipping must be used within six (6) months from the date on which the c redit or free</div>

<div>shipping was made available  to the User on the Platform. </div>

<div>8.2 Promotional codes and/or other offers or discounts offered on the Platform must be</div>

<div>correctly entered into the application before placing the order.  Otherwise, they will not</div>

<div>take e ffect and the User will be unable to enjoy them.  </div>

<div>8.3 Whenever a cancellation is requested by Trovi in accordance with Section 9 below, the</div>

<div>User shall ensure that the promotional code and/or other  offer or discount is valid for future</div>

<div>use. When the cancel lation is at the User's request, Section 9 below will apply. </div>

<div>8.4 Trovi reserves the right to unilaterally cancel promotional codes and/or other offers or</div>

<div>discounts offered if it becomes aware of a fraudulent use  thereof (such as, among others, a</div>

<div>promotion al code being redeemed by someone who is not its legitimate recipient, the mass</div>

<div>communication of  codes or the sale of codes or discounts), at the end of the above </div>

<div>mentioned period. Furthermore, it reserves the right to apply sanctions to Users  for the</div>

<div>amount for which Trovi has been defrauded as a result of such use. </div>

<div>8.5 Trovi will accept no liability if, due to an event of force majeure or other events beyond</div>

<div>its control or whose need is justified, it is forced to  cancel, shorten, extend or amend the</div>

<div>conditions of promotions. </div>

<div>8.6 In particular, Trovi will accept no liability if the website or mobile application   is not</div>

<div>available at any time during promotions or for a  malfunction in the automated promotion</div>

<div>system. </div>

<div>9. Right of Withdrawal and Cancellation  of Orders </div>

<div>9.1 In accordance with the nature of the service offered by Trovi, the User is aware that,</div>

<div>once a Shopper has voluntarily accepted an order, the  execution of the purchase</div>

<div>mandate is considered to have started, and the User may therefore no long er be entitled to</div>

<div>withdraw the service request  free of charge.  </div>

<div>9.2 Without prejudice to the foregoing, the cost of cancellation may depend on the</div>

<div>following factors; </div>

<div>a. If the business place or establishment has already accepted the order and started</div>

<div>preparin g it, the User will be charged the price of the products. The User will be informed of</div>

<div>the restaurant's acceptance through the Platform and/or by email at the email address registered</div>

<div>by the User. </div>





<div>b. If the User cancels the order once the Shopper has accepted it for processing, the User</div>

<div>will be charged the cancellation fee. The User will be informed of the Shopper's   acceptance</div>

<div>through the Platform. The User can see the cost of cancellation on the Platform. If the order is</div>

<div>cancelled by Trovi, the agen ts will contact the User to inform the latter of the cost of</div>

<div>cancellation if there is one. </div>





<div>c. If the restaurant or establishment and the Shopper have accepted the order for</div>

<div>processing, the User will be charged both the price of the products and the cancella tion fee. </div>





<div>d. The total cost of cancellation will appear on the User's screen on pressing the "Cancel"</div>

<div>button on the Platform. The User will be shown the charge to be applied, based on the</div>

<div>factors described above, in advance. </div>

<div>9.3 In the case of non -food or n on-perishable products, if the Shopper has already</div>

<div>purchased the product ordered at the time of cancellation, the User  may ask the Shopper to</div>

<div>return it. To that end, the User must pay the products' full purchase price and delivery costs,</div>

<div>as well as the co st of the  return service. If the Shopper has been able to return the product,</div>

<div>its value will be refunded to the User who, as mentioned above, must pay the  cost of the</div>

<div>two collection and delivery services as well as the return service. The return shall in  any event</div>

<div>be subject to the merchant's return  policies, and the User, therefore, states that he/she is</div>

<div>aware that, in the case of perishable products (e.g., food), the product may not be returned</div>

<div> and Trovi will therefore be entitled to charge him/her for both the product already</div>

<div>purchased by the Shopper under his/her mandate and for the  cost of the delivery service</div>

<div>incurred. </div>

<div>9.4 If the User has given an incorrect delivery address for the products,  he/she may enter a</div>

<div>new address at any time provided that it is within the  same city as the original order and</div>

<div>this is a city in which Trovi provides its intermediation service. In such case, the User will be</div>

<div>ordering a new  service and agrees to be charg ed the appropriate amounts for the new</div>

<div>delivery. If the address is in a different city from the one originally specified, the address may</div>

<div>not be modified for delivery in a new city, and the order will be cancelled, with the User bearing</div>

<div>the resulting cost s as  provided in this clause. </div>

<div>9.5 Trovi reserves the right to cancel an order without having to provide a just cause.   In</div>

<div>the event of cancellation without just cause at Trovi's  for instance, the User shall be</div>

<div>entitled to a refund of the amount paid. </div>

<div>10.1  Special Terms of the Product Purchase Service through Trovi  </div>

<div>10.1.2  If a User wants to know the composition and nutritional information of the products</div>

<div>available on the Platform, he/she must contact each   establishment directly to obtain</div>

<div>full informatio n about the products. </div>

<div>10.1.3  Once the User has selected one of the options, he/she can also complete the order by</div>

<div>using the free -text space provided in order to include more  detailed information or</div>

<div>instructions for the Shopper who is to carry it out. </div>

<div>10.1.4 The User may specify the products to be included in the order by using the free -text</div>

<div>box to include more  detailed information or instructions for the Shopper who is to carry it</div>

<div>out. As a result of the foregoing, the User shall be solely responsible, an d it  would be</div>

<div>the User who, if the situation arose, would be liable for any incident arising from the nature of</div>

<div>the products (such as a sanction, civil  and/or criminal liability, financial liability, etc.).</div>

<div>In relation to this, Users should be aware that  Trovi actively collaborates with the authorities</div>

<div>of  each country to combat, among other crimes, fraud, drug trafficking, money laundering,</div>

<div>terrorism and identity theft. The User is therefore aware  that Trovi may disclose his/her</div>

<div>data to public authoriti es on their request in order to prevent and avoid the commission of these</div>

<div>or other criminal  offences. </div>

<div>10.1.5  The User is aware, and accepts, that the descriptions and, where applicable, the prices</div>

<div>or photographs of the products and/or services available  on the Platform, are provided</div>

<div>based on the information and documents supplied by the establishments and that Trovi is</div>

<div>therefore unable to  provide any guarantees against any possible inaccuracies in such</div>

<div>descriptions, prices and/or photographs. </div>

<div>10.1.6  Furthermore, the User accepts that all the products appearing on the Trovi platform are</div>

<div>subject to availability and, in this regard, accepts the   possibility that, while</div>

<div>carrying out the order, the product and/or service may be found not to be available at th e</div>

<div>establishment. In addition, the   price of the product is subject to slight variations</div>

<div>due to modifications at the point of sale. </div>

<div>10.1.7  Trovi reserves the right to withdraw any product from its platform, as well as to modify</div>

<div>the contents of its informat ion sheet at any time, without  thereby incurring any liability of</div>

<div>any kind. </div>

<div>10.2 Deliveries </div>

<div>Trovi provides Users with a delivery service for products purchased by a Shopper in person in</div>

<div>certain cities. Such an order can be carried out whenever the followi ng conditions are met at</div>

<div>the time of payment: </div>

<div>• The service must be operative during the chosen time slot. </div>

<div>• The goods to be delivered must be in one of the cities, and within the available area, in</div>

<div>which Trovi operates. </div>

<div>• The destination must be located in the same city as the product. </div>

<div>10.3 Price and Payment Method </div>

<div>10.3.1  The price of the product and/or service shall be as stated by the establishment on the</div>

<div>Platform. However, the User knows that the price of some  of the products may vary in real -</div>

<div>time due to stock availability at the establishments appearing on the platform  and that the User</div>

<div>will in any event  always be told the final cost before payment. </div>

<div>10.3.2  From the moment when the Shopper starts shopping an order from the store until its</div>

<div>delivery, the User may contact the Shopper  who will be acting on the User's behal f in the</div>

<div>purchase of products and services. Any change or variation shall therefore be reported by the</div>

<div> Shopper for the User's approval before carrying out the mandate. If the User wishes to</div>

<div>make any comments regarding the order, he/she will  always be abl e to directly contact</div>

<div>the Shopper who is carrying out the mandate. </div>

<div>10.3.3  Similarly, at the payment gateway stage, the User will be informed of the final price</div>

<div>and approximate time of delivery in accordance with the  terms of Trovi's courier service</div>

<div>set fo rth above. </div>

<div>10.3.4  The User may pay for the products and/or services by credit/debit card or via electronic</div>

<div>transfer. The cash payment option may be unavailable in  some of the countries in which</div>

<div>Trovi operates. When making the order, the User will be infor med of the various payment</div>

<div>options available in the  territory from which the service is being requested. In order to</div>

<div>pay with a credit card, the User must provide the card details through the platform  as a</div>

<div>payment method associated with his/her account. Trovi does not store card numbers on its</div>

<div>servers and can only view the last four digits of  the card. The full information shall be</div>

<div>stored on the servers of the payment service provider that makes the payments on Trovi's</div>

<div>behalf. Users  paying by credit car d will incur no additional charges for choosing this payment</div>

<div>method. All this in accordance with the terms of the payment  platform set forth in</div>

<div>Clause 6.1. </div>

<div>10.3.5  The User may not refuse to pay the delivery fee and/or the price of the product ordered.</div>

<div>The User can only refuse to pay the service fee if he/she  has made a complaint and has</div>

<div>received a response from Trovi that is favourable to the User by the time of the delivery. </div>

<div>10.3.6  If payment for the service can for any reason not be taken from the User,  the User's</div>

<div>account shall be blocked until the situation has been  rectified and the debt has been</div>

<div>settled. </div>

<div>10.4 Home Delivery of Free Samples and Other Commercial Actions </div>

<div>Trovi reserves the right to enter into commercial agreements with Stores, Department </div>

<div>Stores, Entrepreneurs, and Professionals (e.g, mass - market food companies, laboratories,</div>

<div>Department Stores, large and small consumer brands, etc.) to send promotional</div>

<div>communications, including  the addition of free samples to the order delivered to the U ser's</div>

<div>home. </div>

<div>11 Geolocation </div>

<div>11.1 Trovi may collect, use and share exact location data, including the real -time geographic</div>

<div>location of the User's computer or mobile device,   provided that this is authorised by</div>

<div>the User. The said location data may be collect ed and used by Trovi to show Users the location</div>

<div>of the point of  origin and/or destination of an assignment. In this regard, Users expressly</div>

<div>consent to their geolocation data being shared with other Users and  Suppliers in order </div>

<div>to successfully carry out t he assignment requested at any given time. Users may choose to</div>

<div>disable Geolocation on their  devices as provided in the Data Privacy Policy. </div>

<div>11.2 The User shall be responsible for entering the correct addresses for collection and</div>

<div>delivery. In this regard, Trovi will accept no liability for errors  or omissions in the</div>

<div>provision of such addresses by the User. </div>

<div>12 The User's Obligations </div>

<div>12.1 Users are f ully responsible for the proper use of, and access to, their profile and other</div>

<div>products  forbidden by any applicable legislation. If Trovi b ecomes aware that the User </div>

<div>and/or the Shopper is/are using the Platform to transport prohibited  products, Trovi</div>

<div>may launch an internal investigation to ascertain the facts, take any legal action that may be</div>

<div>necessary and/or block the User or  Shopper in q uestion until any potential investigation has</div>

<div>been completed. The measures available to Trovi include providing the authorities with</div>

<div> data and information on the Users and Shoppers   .</div>

<div>15.3 Trovi rejects any liability for damages of any kind that may arise from Users' illegal</div>

<div>use of the Platform or due to the information supplied by  Users to other Users about</div>

<div>themselves being untrue, no longer valid, incomplete and/or false and, in particular and without</div>

<div>limitation, for any  loss or damage of any kind that may arise due to a User impersonating</div>

<div>a third party in any kind of communication made through the  Platform.   In particular,</div>

<div>Trovi accepts no responsibility for the use of the Platform or for any orders that may be made</div>

<div>by a third party from the  User's ac count. </div>

<div>Users' access to the Platform, as well as to cancel,  suspend, block or remove certain types of</div>

<div>content, by means of suitable technological tools, if it  becomes aware, or there are signs, that</div>

<div>the  activity or the information stored is illegal or harmful to a third party's rights or</div>

<div>property. In this regard, Trovi may establish any filters that may  be necessary to prevent the</div>

<div>service from being used to u pload unlawful or harmful content to the Internet. By making</div>

<div>content available through  the platform users assign to Trovi all exploitation rights arising</div>

<div>from the contents thus supplied. </div>

<div>15.6 In addition,  Trovi reserves the right to decide on the algorith ms and parameters</div>

<div>applicable to the ranking of the merchants (restaurants and/or  stores) and products that</div>

<div>appear in the Platform, as well as to amend and update it.  The User acknowledges and accepts</div>

<div>that the said ranking may  depend on multiple factors a nd metrics, including but not limited</div>

<div>to the proximity and accessibility of the store, prior reviews, as well as any  agreement</div>

<div>reached by Trovi with said merchants or distributors of the products related to their positioning</div>

<div>and visibility. </div>

<div>16.1 Trovi gives no warranties regarding the authenticity, accuracy, novelty, reliability,</div>

<div>lawfulness or non -infringement of third -party rights by   Shoppers. In this regard,</div>

<div>Users state that they understand that Trovi is a tech nology platform whose main activity is</div>

<div>intermediation; in other   words, it puts Users Merchant/Business Owner/Partner</div>

<div>and Shoppers   in contact with each other; and that it, therefore, accepts no liability </div>

<div> arising from the information provided by Shoppers   or for any loss or damage that may</div>

<div>potentially be suffered by them due to a breach of these  General Terms of Use. When an</div>

<div>order is placed on the Platform and accepted by the Shopper, a direct relationship  is established</div>

<div>between the  User and the Shopper. Trovi is not a party to this relationship and merely</div>

<div>provides the Platform to enable the Parties to communicate and   place as many</div>

<div>orders as may be necessary. Trovi will therefore never be liable for the availability of</div>

<div>Shoppers   or for their adequate and   satisfactory performance of assignments. </div>

<div>16.2 Trovi makes no assertions or confirmation regarding any Shoppers   or their identity or</div>

<div>background information. Notwithstanding the foregoing,  Trovi may pot entially carry out</div>

<div>additional checks and put into motion procedures designed to help check or verify the identity</div>

<div>of Shoppers   . In  this regard, when a User achieves Shopper status, this simply indicates </div>

<div>that the said User has completed the relevant regis tration process and has  accepted these</div>

<div>General Terms of Use and any other specific terms that may apply to him/her. Such status</div>

<div>1. Object </div>

<div>1.1 Trovi is a business enterprise that handles the   development & management of a</div>

<div>technology platform through which certain local  stores in a number of territories can offer</div>

<div>their products and/or services by means of a mobile or web application on the platfo rm</div>

<div>(hereinafter, the  "APP") and, in an ancillary manner, where applicable and if so requested</div>

<div>through the APP by buyers through the APP and consumers of the said local  stores, act</div>

<div>as an intermediary in the planned or immediate delivery of the products. </div>

<div>1.2 Trovi has developed a Platform through which a variety of merchants, with which Trovi</div>

<div>can have in place a commercial agreement for the use of  the platform, offer a selection of </div>

<div>products and/or services. Buyers can request the purchase and/or collection  of products and</div>

<div>services from such  merchants in person by means of a mandate given by them to a third</div>

<div>party when placing an order through the Platform. In such cases, Trovi acts  as a mere</div>

<div>intermediary and is therefore unable to assume, and does not assu me, any responsibility for the</div>

<div>quality of the products or for the  proper provision of the services offered directly by the</div>

<div>merchants or by such third parties. </div>

<div>1.3 In addition, Trovi is a multi -category Technology Platform for intermediation in the</div>

<div>for any persons requiring help with their errands, services, purchases in person and/or</div>

<div>collection of products  from local merchants (hereinafter, "Business Owners or Partners") to</div>

<div>carry out their errands by delegating to such third parties, who are willing  to voluntarily carry</div>

<div>out the mandate given to them by Buyers (hereinafter, the "Shoppers"). </div>

<div>1.4 Shoppers are thus a network of self -employed professionals who work with Trovi.</div>

<div>When they wish to provide their services, verified shoppers log onto the  Shoppers App</div>

<div>("the Platform") and undertake to carry out within a certain amount of time the service</div>

<div>entrusted to them by the Buyers by means  of he above -mentioned manda te. As a result,</div>

<div>Trovi cannot be responsible for delivery times, as they will depend on the local stores' own</div>

<div>  successful operations, the preparation of orders, the Shoppers themselves, and</div>

<div>the information furnished by the Buyer when placing orders or  their availability and</div>

<div>response at the time of delivery. In relation to this, the delivery times stated on the Site are</div>

<div>provided for indicative purposes  only. </div>

<div>that they have received their groceries from the app for buyers. Trovi shoppers would</div>

<div>earn at minimum 72.8%  of the shopping fees charged on buyers for the service they</div>

<div>render. Trovi on the other hand would receive at mini mum   27.2%  of it. </div>

<div>Commissions would rightly increase or reduce based on how far or near a buyer's</div>

<div>care and should drive or ride carefully & sensibly  when  delivering these products to</div>

<div>their respective buyers on time, which would be shown on the app for shoppers. In</div>

<div>scenarios where shopping bags might be damaged or might seem weak in texture,</div>

<div>shopper's are advised to relate this ahead of time to the business  representative</div>

<div>attending to them and get whatever option available to prevent possible loss or</div>

<div>damage   to products.  </div>

<div>• Shoppers should ensure that their rider or driver's   licenses or those of their vehicle</div>

<div>and permits of their means of transport  are up-to-date and meet the requirements of</div>

<div>local available laws in the area. </div>

<div>• Respectfulness to the police or other road or highway agency should always be adhered</div>

<div>to for shoppers. Kennis Viden Limited would cooperate with available agencies to</div>

<div>smoothen the process of delivery without bias, for shoppers in accordance with the law</div>

<div>of the land. </div>

<div>• Shoppers should not try to solicit extra monies from the buyer after bringing their</div>

<div>ordered products to them. Trying to negotiate a higher price than what the buyer initially</div>

<div>paid for their service is highly prohibited.  </div>

<div>• Shoppers should avoid wearing attires that are not appropriate for handling shopping</div>

<div>after each successful delivery. The Shoppers have the right to provide honest &</div>

<div>unbiased feedback based on what they observed. Each and every report sent to the Trovi</div>

<div>team would be appropriately scrutinized and actions if applicable wou ld be taken in</div>

<div>situations where the buyers feedback is highly negative. </div>

<div>items to the buyers. This could help to save more time. </div>

<div>arising from such deliveries must be communicated to Trovi via the any of the contact</div>

<div>options on the app for shoppers.  </div>

<div>• The reviews given by buyers to the shoppers after they've received their order would</div>

<div>situations. </div>

<div>• Shoppers are allowed to take tips offered to them by buyers as they wish. The bett er the</div>

<div>service and overall experience you render as a shopper, the more likely you would be</div>

<div>to be tipped by buyers. For example, assisting a buyer carry their products to where</div>

<div>they permit you to keep them could be considered a kind gesture which could res ult in</div>

<div>good reviews left for you on the app amongst other rewards.  </div>

<div>• Shoppers would be responsible for products damaged in their care during the shopping</div>

<div>and delivery process. Payment for this to the buyer should be made in full and might</div>

<div>lead to restrictio ns on their accounts on the platform if they refrain from complying.  </div>

<div>• Shoppers are required to pay a non -refundable onboarding fee of N2000 , after</div>

<div>successful registration as a shopper. Thereafter, a shoppers manual and Trovi t -shirt</div>

<div>can reach out to any of our support handles on social media or on any official Trovi</div>

<div>group. </div>

<div>• Shoppers going to partnered stores must use the designated check out point for</div>

<div>shoppers, at partnered stores after they are don e shopping items on behalf of a buyer as</div>

<div>stated in the commercial agreement between Trovi and the partnered business. This is</div>

<div>to ensure that they don't have to wait in lines or stand in queues, and that their products</div>

<div>can easily be checked, payment can be confirmed and that they're on their way to</div>

<div>deliver the shopped items. </div>

<div>the addresses specified. The Shopper undertakes under a mandate to purchase the  products</div>

<div>ordered by the Shopp er on the latter's behalf and according to his/her indications and</div>

<div>specifications. </div>

<div>4.2 The Shopper will not be liable to any liability for negligence or error in the collection</div>

<div>or delivery of the order as a result of the Buyer providing  incorrect addresse s for collection</div>

<div>and delivery of the Buyer's order. As a result of the foregoing, the cost resulting from providing</div>

<div>an incorrect  address for collection and delivery on the Platform shall be borne by the Buyer. </div>

<div>session will be deactivated and cleared as soon as the shopper confirms that they have received</div>

<div>the product or the  order is cancelled for any of the reason s envisaged. If a buyer wishes to</div>

<div>contact the Shopper or Trovi after the order has been completed, he/she  must use the</div>

<div>contact form available on the Platform and contact the buyer assistance service. The Shopper</div>

<div>incorrect  indications on the Platform regarding the products (such as an incorrect address</div>

<div>that  were not delivered on time. The Shopper will in this situation be liable for  the</div>

<div>deterioration or expiry of the product to which the assignment is  related. Trovi</div>

<div>might authorise the Shopper to bring such products to a nearby Trovi office. The buyer</div>
